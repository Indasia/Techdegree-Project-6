In this project, I'll create a gorgeous portfolio site to showcase the great projects I've built. I used JSON to store all the data about the previous projects I've created. I used Pug to complete provided templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser. Node.js and Express were also used in this project.

CSS changes:
new font
new sidebar background
new button background
"github" and "live demo" button fades when you hover
"learn more" and "back" button color changes when you hover
